To identify running processes:

Method 1 : 'top'
Use the command:

$ top

This displays all running processes.
Use Ctrl+C to exit.

Method 2 : 'ps'
Use the command:

$ ps aux | grep <ProcessName>

This runs the Process Snapshot (PS) function with the options:
  a - (All) - Shows processes for all users
  u - (User/Owner) - Shows the owner of the process
  x - (eXternal) - Shows processes not attached to the terminal

The output is then piped to 'grep', which will truncate output only to lines matching a pattern.

ie.

root@kali:~# ps | grep bash
 2470 pts/0    00:00:00 bash

In either case, you may wish to record the process number for future reference.
