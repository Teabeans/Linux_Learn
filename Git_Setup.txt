================================================================================
STEP 1 - INSTALL GIT TO UBUNTU LINUX VIA THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
================================================================================

From the CLI, enter the command:

$ git --version

If Git is already installed, you will see the version report. As of 2019.01.18, this was:

git version 2.17.1

If Git is not installed, the command will not be recognized. In this case, you may install Git using the command:
