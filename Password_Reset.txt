In the event that a password is forgotton (and you have physical access to the device), you may attempt the following:

1) During boot sequence, when "GNU GRUB version #.## appears, highlight the typical boot menu entry.
2) Press 'E' to edit the entry
3) Scroll down to a line that reads something like:

linux    /boot/vmlinux-4.17.0-kali3-amd64 root=/dev/sda1 ro_initrd=/ [...] init=/bin/bash

4) Replace 'ro' with 'rw'
5) Locate the keyword 'quiet' and replace it with 'init=/bin/bash'
6) ???
7) Type 'mount' and look for the / root mount partition.
8) Confirm that this partition is mounted with 'rw' permissions.
9) Run the command:

$ passwd

10) Confirm the pass twice
11) Reboot
12) Profit!
